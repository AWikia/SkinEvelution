# EvelutionDocs Skin Information

Evelution Documentation doesn't use a basic reader-like layout but rather an advanced themed layout that can make the site unique.

## About the Skin

This skin is based on the Cayman Jekyll theme, one of the themes available for use in GitHub pages with various modifications to match the look and feel of the Evelution Skin.

It is nicknamed as EvelutionDocs and is a minimal Environment of Evelution. Differences from Cayman theme include:
- Persistent Taskbar and Community Header. The latter does not include local nav or counters and the former lacks dynamic content
- Support for themes, which use the CPE Language System and supports the advanced Theming Engine found in CPE Language, Evelution and Ivilution
- Support for Dark Mode. All eight themes included support dark mode
- A more responsive layout for Larger Screens
- Visited Hyperlink Support
- Various other enchancements, including highlights for table headers and use of Secondary font in headings. Level 3 headings onward also have bold text for better legibility

However, there're several downsides compared to the full Evelution Experience:
- No support for Luna Lovit or Levit
- No support for Visual Styles or extra color schemes (Only a single color scheme is given alongside Disabled Color Management and although only a single visual style is given which is the base ones, it does support the High Contrast Visual Mode)
- No support for Advanced Color Modes and Luna Lavccent in the GUI (See [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Evelution#URL_Parameters) for the URL parameters supported by CPE Language for alternative way of using advanced color modes temporarly)
- No support for Full Width Mode (Small devices, do however display the Documentation using full width container)
- No Local Navigation or Right Rail Support (The contents menu in the documentation partially resolves this)
- No support for GPU Levels (GPU Level is always locked to Level 1)

## Reporting bugs

If you have something to report about the layout, use the GitHub issues or do it so on our Discord Server (Link found in the bottom of the taskbar that says Support Server in the tooltip)

## 2023 Revision

In 2023, the Documentation Site was slightly redesigned to match the layout used in later Evelution Skin revisions.

The advanced theming engine which also brings the advanced forced colors mode support was added as well to reduce filesize on CSS code used for themes.

Last but not least, the Full CPE Language Core is now being present instead of having a subset of it included

## 2022 Revision

In 2022, the Documentation Site was redesigned to match the layout of the later Evelution Skin revisions, including a bottom Taskbar, persistent Minibar and support for themes albeit without the advanced theming engine found in CPE Language, Evelution and Ivilution.

This revision also makes the layout a lot better for larger screens by adding support for the Desktop Background Color and making the page container more like the ones found in Evelution. Additional usage of Secondary font and Rounded corners has made into the redesign as well.

Last but not least, full theming support has been added, meaning the Documentation can be shown in Dark Mode as well as in other alternative color schemes.

## Initial Revision

In the very early stages of the Documentations, an unmodded Cayman Jekyll theme was used. However, it was later modified to use the Left Global Nav, Superbar and Minibar from the Evelution Skin to make it look alike to Evelution.
